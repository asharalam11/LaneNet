The task of lane detection is still vital to the success of autonomous vehicles because it is pertinent that an autonomous vehicle can exactly recognize which lane it is in and where it needs to go. If it is not able to do that, the vehicles might be going in the middle of two lanes which can be dangerous for other vehicles in the vicinity. Also, lane detection is inevitable to perform maneuvers like lane changes and also for predicting other vehicles’ behavior."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fKhKOATu5O3h","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# __Build a lane extractor from an image__\n","In this project, we tried to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract lane markings as features from given images of roads with lanes. \n","\n","### __Dataset Description__\n","We plan on using the __CULane Dataset__ (Chinese University Lane Dataset) which contains 88,880 images for the training set, 9,675 images for the validation set and 34,680 images for the test set. Furthermore, the test set is divided into one normal and 8 challenging categories that tests the network on harder images.
